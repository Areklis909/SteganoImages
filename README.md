# SteganoImages
Steganography is an art of hiding messages using other medium than text. 
This code implements encoding/decoding of a text message into picture/image
by splitting the message to a bit stream and changing only a LSB of each pixel.
This technique does not really impact how people perceive the image, so the text is hidden.
